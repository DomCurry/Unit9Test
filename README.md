The repository for the test of my Unity skills as requested by unit9

Installation
============
The build can be found in the "Build" folder
I think you can download and run those in a web browser

Incase that doesn't work the game can also be played here

How to Play
===========
Click the play button with your mouse to start the game
you are the green capsule
press spacebar to gain height

try to avoid touching things - any object will kill you! /n
you can shoot at the turrets /n
 - you need to be able to see the blue part/n
 - a laser will appear and start to charge/n
 - once it is charged you will fire a bullet and the turret will die!/n
  /n
the objective is to gain height - that's your score/n
the level repsonds to your position/n
in order to be allowed higher you have to be higher /n
(the ceiling and floor spawn in about your current position)/n

Things I would do if I had more time
====================================
Spend a decent amount of time making things look good/n
 - more intricate models/n
 - better textures/n
 - cripser particles/n
 - link background parrallax to camera movement not player movement/n
the game to me feels 'slow' /n
 - perhaps a slow increase of speed as the level progresses/n
rebindable keys /n
a way to get back to the menu /n
a pause screen /n
more types of enemies? /n
tutorial /n
designed levels /n
a story /n
