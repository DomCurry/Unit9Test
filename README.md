Unit9Test
=========

The repository for the test of my Unity skills as requested by unit9

Installation
============
The build can be found in the "Build" folder
I think you can download and run those in a web browser

Incase that doesn't work the game can also be played here

How to Play
===========
 - Click the play button with your mouse to start the game
 - you are the green capsule
 - press spacebar to gain height


 - try to avoid touching things - any object will kill you!
 - you can shoot at the turrets
 - you need to be able to see the blue part
 - a laser will appear and start to charge
 - once it is charged you will fire a bullet and the turret will die!


 - the objective is to gain height - that's your score
 - the level repsonds to your position
 - in order to be allowed higher you have to be higher 
 - (the ceiling and floor spawn in about your current position)

Things I would do if I had more time
====================================
 - Spend a decent amount of time making things look good
 - more intricate models
 - better textures
 - cripser particles
 - link background parrallax to camera movement not player movement
 - the game to me feels 'slow'
 - perhaps a slow increase of speed as the level progresses
 - rebindable keys 
 - a way to get back to the menu 
 - a pause screen 
 - more types of enemies? 
 - tutorial 
 - designed levels 
 - a story
